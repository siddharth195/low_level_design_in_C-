The Prototype design pattern is a creational pattern that allows you to create new objects by copying an existing object, known as a prototype. This pattern is particularly useful when the cost of creating a new object is disproportionately high to the cost of cloning an existing object. The Prototype pattern allows for adding or removing objects at runtime without specifying their concrete classes, thereby making the system more flexible.

Prototype: An interface that declares the cloning method.
Concrete Prototype: An implementation of the Prototype interface that defines the method for duplicating itself.
Client: Creates new objects by asking a prototype to clone itself.

Example Scenario
Let's consider an example where we need to create various shapes (e.g., circles, rectangles) and be able to clone them. This scenario can illustrate how the Prototype pattern can be applied.
