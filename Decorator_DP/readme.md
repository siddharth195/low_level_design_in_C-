he Decorator design pattern is a structural pattern that allows you to dynamically add behavior to objects without affecting the behavior of other objects of the same class. This pattern is particularly useful when you want to add responsibilities to individual objects, not to an entire class. The Decorator pattern provides a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.

Key Concepts
Component: An interface or abstract class for objects that can have responsibilities added to them.
Concrete Component: A class that implements the Component interface and has default behavior.
Decorator: An abstract class that implements the Component interface and has a reference to a Component object. It forwards the requests to this object and can add extra functionality.
Concrete Decorators: Classes that extend the Decorator class to add specific behaviors to the Component.
Example Scenario
Let's consider an example where we have a basic Coffee class. We want to be able to add various enhancements to the coffee, such as milk, sugar, or caramel. Using the Decorator pattern, we can add these enhancements dynamically to any Coffee object.
