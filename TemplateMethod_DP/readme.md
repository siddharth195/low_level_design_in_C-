The Template Method design pattern is a behavioral pattern that defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a method, deferring some steps to subclasses. This pattern lets subclasses redefine certain steps of an algorithm without changing its structure. It's particularly useful when you want to implement the invariant parts of an algorithm once and allow subclasses to implement behavior that can vary.

Key Concepts
Abstract Class: Defines the template method and declares abstract methods for the steps that need to be implemented by subclasses.
Template Method: A method that defines the algorithm's structure and calls the abstract methods to carry out the steps.
Concrete Class: Implements the abstract methods to provide specific behavior for the steps defined in the template method.
Example Scenario
Let's consider an example where we have a process of preparing different types of beverages, such as tea and coffee. Preparing a beverage involves common steps like boiling water, pouring into a cup, adding condiments, etc., but the specific steps for making tea or coffee vary.
