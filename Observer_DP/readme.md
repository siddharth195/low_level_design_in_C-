The Observer design pattern is a behavioral pattern that defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object (the subject) changes state, all its dependents (observers) are notified and updated automatically. This pattern is particularly useful for implementing distributed event-handling systems.

Key Concepts
Subject: An interface or abstract class defining methods to attach, detach, and notify observers.
Concrete Subject: A class that implements the Subject interface and maintains the state of interest. It notifies observers when its state changes.
Observer: An interface or abstract class defining an update method that will be called when the subject's state changes.
Concrete Observer: A class that implements the Observer interface and updates itself based on changes in the subject.
Example Scenario
Letâ€™s consider an example where we have a weather station (subject) that monitors temperature changes and notifies various displays (observers) when the temperature changes.
