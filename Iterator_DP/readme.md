The Iterator design pattern is a behavioral pattern that provides a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation. This pattern is particularly useful when you need to traverse a collection of objects in a uniform manner, regardless of the collection's internal structure.

Key Concepts
Iterator: An interface that defines operations for traversing elements of a collection.
Concrete Iterator: A class that implements the Iterator interface and provides the actual traversal of the collection.
Aggregate: An interface that defines operations to create an iterator object.
Concrete Aggregate: A class that implements the Aggregate interface and returns an instance of the appropriate Iterator for its collection.
Example Scenario
Let's consider an example where we have a collection called BookCollection, and we want to traverse this collection to read the titles of all books it contains. We'll use the Iterator pattern to achieve this in a clean and structured manner.
