The Composite design pattern is a structural pattern that allows you to compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. It treats individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly. The pattern is particularly useful when dealing with hierarchies of objects, where each object might be a simple element or a composition of other elements.

Key Concepts
Component: An abstract class or interface that defines the operations that can be performed on both simple and composite objects.
Leaf: A class that represents a simple object with no children. It implements the Component interface.
Composite: A class that represents a composite object (an object that can have children). It also implements the Component interface and defines methods to add, remove, and access children.
Example Scenario
Let's consider an example where we want to represent a file system hierarchy, consisting of files and directories. Both files and directories should be treated uniformly through a common interface. Using the Composite pattern, we can create a tree structure that represents this hierarchy.
