The Abstract Factory design pattern is a creational pattern that provides an interface for creating families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes. It is often used when a system should be independent of how its objects are created, composed, and represented, and when you want to provide a class library of products that reveals only their interfaces, not their implementations.

Abstract Products: Declares interfaces for a set of related or dependent objects.
Concrete Products: Implements the abstract product interfaces.
Abstract Factory: Declares a set of methods for creating abstract products.
Concrete Factories: Implements methods defined in the abstract factory to create concrete products.

Let's consider an example where we need to create UI components (e.g., Buttons, Checkboxes) for different operating systems (Windows, MacOS). Using an abstract factory, we can handle the instantiation of these components for each specific operating system.

UI component
- button
- checkbox 

UI component factory
- windows factory (create button , c)
- 


Windows factory -> createCheckbox()
