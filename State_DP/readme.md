The State design pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. The object will appear to change its class. This pattern is especially useful when the behavior of an object varies based on its state, and it helps in organizing code that includes state-dependent behavior.

Key Concepts
State Interface: Defines an interface for encapsulating the behavior associated with a particular state of the context.
Concrete States: Implementations of the State interface that encapsulate the behavior specific to a particular state.
Context: The class that maintains an instance of a State subclass and delegates state-specific behavior to this instance.
Example Scenario
Letâ€™s consider an example where we have a MediaPlayer that can be in different states, such as Playing, Paused, or Stopped. The behavior of the MediaPlayer changes depending on its current state. Using the State pattern, we can manage these state-specific behaviors more effectively.
