The Builder design pattern is a creational pattern that allows for the step-by-step construction of complex objects. Unlike other creational patterns, which involve creating products in a single step, the Builder pattern constructs the product in a series of steps. This pattern is particularly useful when the construction process of an object is complex, involving many parts or requiring several different representations.

Key Concepts
Product: The complex object that is being constructed.
Builder Interface: An abstract interface that defines the various steps required to build the product.
Concrete Builder: Implements the Builder interface to construct and assemble parts of the product.
Director: Accepts a Builder object and constructs the product using the builder's methods.
Client: Uses the Director and ConcreteBuilder to construct a product.
Example Scenario

Let's consider a scenario where we need to construct different types of meals (e.g., VegMeal, NonVegMeal). Each meal consists of multiple parts (e.g., burger, drink). We'll use the Builder pattern to handle the construction of these meals.
