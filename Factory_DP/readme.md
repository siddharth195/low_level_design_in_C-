The Factory Method design pattern is a creational pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, while allowing subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. The main purpose is to define an interface for creating an object, but allow subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.

Key Concepts
Product: An interface or abstract class that defines the objects the factory method creates.
ConcreteProduct: Concrete implementations of the Product interface.
Creator: An abstract class that declares the factory method, which returns an object of type Product.
ConcreteCreator: Concrete implementations of the Creator class that override the factory method to return an instance of a ConcreteProduct.

Let's consider an example where we create different types of documents (e.g., PDF, Word, Excel). A factory method will be used to handle the instantiation of these document types.
