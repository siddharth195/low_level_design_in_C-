The Adapter design pattern is a structural pattern that allows incompatible interfaces to work together. It acts as a bridge between two incompatible interfaces by wrapping an existing class with a new interface. This pattern is especially useful when integrating a new component into an existing system where the new component has a different interface than what is expected.

Key Concepts
Target: The interface that the client expects to work with.
Adaptee: The existing class with an incompatible interface.
Adapter: A wrapper that implements the Target interface and translates client requests to calls on the Adaptee.
Example Scenario
Let's consider a scenario where we have a system that uses different types of media players. The existing system can only play MP3 files using an MP3Player interface. Now, we want to integrate a new media player that can play MP4 files. We'll use the Adapter pattern to make the new media player compatible with the existing system.
