The Command design pattern is a behavioral pattern that turns a request into a stand-alone object that contains all the information about the request. This transformation allows for parameterizing methods with different requests, queuing requests, logging them, and supporting undoable operations.

Key Concepts
Command Interface: Defines a method for executing a command.
Concrete Command: Implements the Command interface and defines the specific action to be performed.
Receiver: The object that performs the actual action when the commandâ€™s execute method is called.
Invoker: The object that holds and executes commands.
Client: The object that creates concrete command instances and associates them with receivers.
Example Scenario
Let's consider an example where we want to develop a simple remote control for a home automation system. The remote control (invoker) will execute commands (such as turning lights on/off and opening/closing a garage door) encapsulated in command objects.
