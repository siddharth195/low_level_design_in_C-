The Strategy design pattern is a behavioral pattern that enables selecting an algorithm's behavior at runtime. By defining a family of algorithms, encapsulating each one, and making them interchangeable, the Strategy pattern allows the algorithm to vary independently of the clients that use it. This is particularly useful for implementing complex algorithms or behaviors that may change in different situations or as the application evolves.

Key Concepts
Strategy: An interface common to all supported algorithms.
Concrete Strategies: Classes that implement the Strategy interface and encapsulate specific algorithms.
Context: The class that uses a Strategy to execute a particular behavior. The Context maintains a reference to a Strategy object and delegates the algorithm execution to it.
Example Scenario
Letâ€™s consider an example where we need to implement different sorting strategies for a collection of numbers. We want to be able to choose between various sorting algorithms (e.g., Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, and Merge Sort) at runtime.
